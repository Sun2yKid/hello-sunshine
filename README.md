# hello-sunshine
say hello to my favorite.

Do you know why I named my account name like this?
Everything has meanings as for me. 
Sun2yKid    Sunny is my first-love's name. Kid is my name. She was Sun 2 me. But not any more...
I can't help thinking about her. I can't forget her. I don't even know if I still like her. I am just so depressed. 
My sun gone, my world is full of darkness. I see no light. I see no future. Like Amumu, the Sad Mummy. 
Hello, my sunshine. Will you come back again? I was, is, will always be waiting. Just for you.
